# Promise-Scholar-Website

This website is designed to provide an easy yet functional way for students to be able to see any upcoming important calendar date and event. The website was meant to be simple, effective, and very user friendly. 

The quarter is broken down by weeks, ten in total, so a student can click on a week and the individual dates will slide down with or without events depending on the day. When a user clicks on the event, on mobile version, an overlay will pop out with a box in front explaining the specific information for that particular event. 

While on desktop version, the weeks will work in the same manner with the exception of how the event information is viewed. While on desktop version, the user will click on the particular event,and the event information will slide down or up.

As this is the first project I create, there will be quite a few errors. Any feedback is highly aappreciated! I will continue working on this particular website and continue to improve it as my general knowledge in the field grows.
